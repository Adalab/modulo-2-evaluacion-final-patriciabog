# Module: 2 evaluation final Patricia Montes de oca🍸

The exercise consists of developing a web application that contains a list of drinks and cocktails from around the world, which allows us to mark or unmark drinks as favorites and save them in local storage. 

The cocktail search application consists two parts:
1. A text field and a button to search for a cocktail by name.
2. A list of search results where the image of the cocktail and the name appear.

All this using JavaScript, SASS and HTML.



## Optimizations 🛠

Has been used DOM advanced to paint the lists of cocktails and favorite cocktails, as well has been used to apply style to change background color when the client click on a cocktail as a favorite.



## Lessons Learned💪

While I was building this project I learned to understand better the estructure of JavaScript and how to use it.

The challenges that I faced was to find a fuction to save in the localStorage the favorites, so when I search another cocktail the favorites can still be there. I overcome it esentially with  JSON.stringfy and paint them with my friend DOM advanced.
